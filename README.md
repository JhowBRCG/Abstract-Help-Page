<p> I made this project using a website called <a href = "https://frontendpractice.com">Front-End Practice</a>. It's a good website for those who wants to practice their skills on Front-End. </p>

## ðŸ’» Project

Like I said in the introduction, this project is a copy from a page that I attempted to create using a website called <a href = "https://frontendpractice.com">Front-End Practice</a> .

The page is bassicaly a help page who contains a navigation menu friendly with the mobiles, a help section and is fully responsive.

The Original Page: <a href = "https://help.abstract.com/hc/en-us">help.abstract.com</a>
